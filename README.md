Web interaction system flow:
-The visitorâ€™s web browser requests the web page using a standard URL.
-The web server software (typically Apache) recognizes that the requested file is 
a PHP script, so the server fires up the PHP interpreter to execute the code contained in the file.
-Certain PHP commands (which will be the focus of this chapter) connect to the 
MySQL database and request the content that belongs in the web page.
-The MySQL database responds by sending the requested content to the PHP script.
-The PHP script stores the content into one or more PHP variables, then uses 
echo statements to output the content as part of the web page.
-The PHP interpreter finishes up by handing a copy of the HTML it has created to the web server.
-The web server sends the HTML to the web browser as it would a plain HTML file, 
except that instead of coming directly from an HTML file, the page is the output 
provided by the PHP interpreter.

How to communicate with MySQL through command prompt:
type: mysql -u root -p
type: TheRootPassword
type: SHOW DATABASES;
type: CREATE DATABASE databasename;
type: USE databasename;

example CREATE TABLE joke (	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
							joketext TEXT,
							jokedate DATE NOT NULL)
							DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
							
type: CREATE TABLE joke ( -> id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -> joketext TEXT, ->
jokedate DATE NOT NULL -> ) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;

type: SHOW TABLES;
type: DESCRIBE databasename;

example INSERT INTO joke
		SET joketext = "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!", jokedate = "2009-04-01";
		
type: INSERT INTO joke SET ->
		joketext = "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!", ->
		jokedate = "2009-04-01";

type: SELECT * FROM databasename; (Gets everything)
type: SELECT id, jokedate FROM joke; (Gets only id and jokedate)
type: SELECT id, LEFT(joketext, 20), jokedate FROM joke; (Gets id, joketext and jokedate. Joketext is limited to 20 chars)

type: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM databasename; (counts the number of rows in the table)
type: SELECT joketext FROM joke WHERE joketext LIKE "%chicken%"; (gets joketext that includes the word chicken"

etc....

Variables, declaration and string combination
$variablename = assignedvalue;
$avariable = 'text';
$anothervariable = "$avariable andmoretext";
$anothervariable = $avariable . "andmoretext";
$avariable = digit;

Arrays
$myarray = array('one', 2, '3');
echo $myarray[0];					//Outputs 'one'
$myarray[1] = 'two';				//Sets index 1 to 'two'

$birthdays = array('Kevin' => '1978-04-12', 'Stephanie' => '1980-05-16', 'David' => '1983-09-09');
$birthdays['Kevin'] = '1979-04-12';
echo 'My birthday is: ' . $birthdays['Kevin'];
